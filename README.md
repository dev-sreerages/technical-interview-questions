# React Technical Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. What is React?
**Answer**: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, mainly for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps.

## 2. What are the main features of React?
**Answer**: The main features of React are:
- JSX: JavaScript XML syntax used to create elements.
- Components: Reusable pieces of UI.
- Virtual DOM: Efficiently updates and renders components.
- Unidirectional Data Flow: Data flows in one direction, making it easier to debug.

## 3. What is JSX?
**Answer**: JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It's a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML and is used with React to describe what the UI should look like.

## 4. What is the Virtual DOM?
**Answer**: The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. React uses it to optimize updates by comparing it with the real DOM and updating only the changed parts.

## 5. What are React Components?
**Answer**: Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable pieces of UI that can be functional or class-based.

## 6. What is the difference between state and props?
**Answer**: 
- **State**: Local data storage that is managed within the component.
- **Props**: Read-only data passed from parent to child components.

## 7. What are hooks in React?
**Answer**: Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Examples include useState, useEffect, and useContext.

## 8. What is the useState hook?
**Answer**: useState is a hook that lets you add state to functional components. It returns an array with the current state value and a function to update it.

## 9. What is the useEffect hook?
**Answer**: useEffect is a hook that lets you perform side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, and manual DOM manipulations.

## 10. What is the context API?
**Answer**: The context API is a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

## 11. How do you create a React component?
**Answer**: You can create a React component using a function or a class. Functional components use a function to return JSX, while class components extend React.Component and use a render method.

## 12. What is a higher-order component (HOC)?
**Answer**: A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with added functionality.

## 13. How do you handle events in React?
**Answer**: Events in React are handled using camelCase syntax for event names and passing event handler functions directly in JSX.

## 14. What is the purpose of keys in React?
**Answer**: Keys help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed. They should be unique and stable.

## 15. What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?
**Answer**: 
- **Controlled Components**: Form inputs that derive their value from the component state.
- **Uncontrolled Components**: Form inputs that maintain their own state.

## 16. How do you lift state up in React?
**Answer**: Lifting state up involves moving the state to a common ancestor component so that it can be shared between multiple child components.

## 17. What is Redux?
**Answer**: Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications. It provides a predictable state container and follows principles such as a single source of truth and immutable state updates.

## 18. How do you use Redux with React?
**Answer**: To use Redux with React, you need to create a store, define reducers, and use the Provider component to pass the store to your React components. You can then use hooks like useSelector and useDispatch to interact with the store.

## 19. What is the purpose of middleware in Redux?
**Answer**: Middleware in Redux provides a way to extend Redux with custom functionality, such as logging, handling asynchronous actions, and error reporting.

## 20. What is React Router?
**Answer**: React Router is a library for routing in React applications. It enables navigation between different components and allows for dynamic routing.

## 21. How do you handle forms in React?
**Answer**: Forms in React can be handled using controlled components, where the form inputs are tied to the component state, or using libraries like Formik for more complex forms.

## 22. What is the difference between useEffect and useLayoutEffect?
**Answer**: 
- **useEffect**: Runs after the render is committed to the screen.
- **useLayoutEffect**: Runs synchronously after all DOM mutations but before the browser has a chance to paint.

## 23. What are React Fragments?
**Answer**: React Fragments let you group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. They are used to return multiple elements from a component.

## 24. How do you optimize performance in a React application?
**Answer**: Performance optimization techniques include using React.memo, useCallback, useMemo, code-splitting, lazy loading, and avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

## 25. What is the useReducer hook?
**Answer**: useReducer is a hook that provides an alternative to useState for more complex state logic. It takes a reducer function and an initial state and returns the current state and a dispatch function.

## 26. How do you handle errors in React?
**Answer**: Errors in React can be handled using error boundaries, which catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree and render a fallback UI.

## 27. What is PropTypes in React?
**Answer**: PropTypes is a library for type-checking the props passed to a component, ensuring they are of the correct type and shape.

## 28. What is the difference between class components and functional components?
**Answer**: 
- **Class Components**: Use ES6 classes, have lifecycle methods, and manage state with this.state.
- **Functional Components**: Use functions, can use hooks for state and lifecycle methods, and are generally simpler and easier to test.

## 29. What is the useRef hook?
**Answer**: useRef is a hook that returns a mutable ref object whose .current property is initialized to the passed argument. It can be used to access DOM elements directly.

## 30. How do you perform data fetching in React?
**Answer**: Data fetching in React can be done using the useEffect hook along with fetch API, Axios, or other data-fetching libraries.

## 31. What is code-splitting?
**Answer**: Code-splitting is a technique to split your code into smaller bundles, which can be loaded on demand. This improves the performance of your application by reducing the initial load time.

## 32. What is lazy loading in React?
**Answer**: Lazy loading in React is the process of loading components only when they are needed. This can be achieved using React.lazy and Suspense.

## 33. What is the purpose of React.StrictMode?
**Answer**: React.StrictMode is a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants.

## 34. What is the useCallback hook?
**Answer**: useCallback is a hook that returns a memoized callback function, which helps to prevent unnecessary re-renders by ensuring the same instance of the function is used unless its dependencies change.

## 35. What is the useMemo hook?
**Answer**: useMemo is a hook that returns a memoized value. It helps to optimize performance by memoizing the result of an expensive computation and recomputing it only when its dependencies change.

## 36. How do you handle side effects in React?
**Answer**: Side effects in React can be handled using the useEffect hook. This hook allows you to perform actions like data fetching, subscriptions, and manually changing the DOM.

## 37. What is React Context?
**Answer**: React Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It is useful for global state management.

## 38. What is server-side rendering (SSR)?
**Answer**: Server-side rendering is the process of rendering React components on the server and sending the generated HTML to the client. This improves performance and SEO.

## 39. What is the use of React.PureComponent?
**Answer**: React.PureComponent is a base class for components that only re-render when their props or state change. It provides a shallow comparison of props and state to optimize performance.

## 40. What is the difference between useState and useReducer?
**Answer**: 
- **useState**: Simplest way to manage state in a functional component.
- **useReducer**: More powerful and flexible way to manage state, especially for complex state logic.

## 41. What is React's reconciliation algorithm?
**Answer**: React's reconciliation algorithm, also known as the Diffing algorithm, is used to determine the minimal number of changes needed to update the UI efficiently.

## 42. What is the purpose of React.memo?
**Answer**: React.memo is a higher-order component that memoizes the rendered output of a functional component, preventing unnecessary re-renders when the props haven't changed.

## 43. What is the difference between React and React Native?
**Answer**: 
- **React**: Library for building web applications.
- **React Native**: Framework for building mobile applications using React.

## 44. How do you handle authentication in a React application?
**Answer**: Authentication can be handled using libraries like Firebase, Auth0, or by implementing custom authentication logic with JWT tokens and context for state management.

## 45. What are portals in React?
**Answer**: Portals provide a way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.

## 46. How do you test React components?
**Answer**: React components can be tested using frameworks and libraries like Jest, React Testing Library, and Enzyme to perform unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.

## 47. What is the purpose of the useImperativeHandle hook?
**Answer**: useImperativeHandle is a hook that customizes the instance value that is exposed to parent components when using ref. It is used in conjunction with forwardRef.

## 48. How do you manage global state in a React application?
**Answer**: Global state can be managed using Context API, Redux, or other state management libraries like MobX or Zustand.

## 49. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous state updates in React?
**Answer**: 
- **Synchronous State Updates**: Occur immediately and are handled by the React event loop.
- **Asynchronous State Updates**: May be batched and processed later to optimize performance.

## 50. How do you handle routing in a React application?
**Answer**: Routing in a React application can be handled using React Router, which provides components and hooks for navigating between different views and managing URL parameters.
